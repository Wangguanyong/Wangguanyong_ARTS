            int maxLen = 0;
            std::string maxParlindromic;
            for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i)

                int maxOddTmp = 0;
                for(int j = 1; i - j >= 0 && i + j < sLen; ++j)

                }
                if(maxLen < 2 * maxOddTmp + 1)
                {
                    maxLen = 2 * maxOddTmp + 1;
                    maxParlindromic = s.substr(i - maxOddTmp,  maxLen);
                }

                int maxEvenTmp = 0;
                for(int j = 1; i - j >= 0 && i + j - 1< sLen; ++j)
                {

                    if(s[i-j] == s[i + j - 1])
                    {
                        ++maxEvenTmp;
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        break;
                    }

                }

                if(maxLen < 2 * maxEvenTmp)
                {
                    maxLen = 2 * maxEvenTmp;
                    maxParlindromic = s.substr(i - maxEvenTmp, maxLen);
                }
            }
            return maxParlindromic;
        }
};
```
This is the simplest way to solve this problem. There to matter must be attention.
1.The odd and even number of the parlindromic length are different case.
2. Be attention not cross the border of input string.

### [The main pillars of learning programming — and why beginners should master them.](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-main-pillars-of-learning-programming-and-why-beginners-should-master-them-e04245c17c56)
In this article, the writer share the five important things for beginer of programming learning.
1. Test-Driven-Development. Should know how to write test case while learning program.
2. Fundamental First.The function, variable, loop, condition is the fundamental for programming. 
3. Library and framwork. Library and framwork are helpfull.
4. Master & Apprentice. Find a mentor to help you at first.
5. Challenge and Motivition. Set a appropriate goal for practice.
Now, most people learn programming by themselves, it's hard for them to find a teacher or mentor. So it's important tho learn skills through Internet, via blog, wiki or github, we can learn the skills we needed in work.

### Insertation Sort
In this week I learned insertation sort. Insertation sort is simple, but it's the basic part of shell sort. So I will instroduce the sort algorithm firts.
Like we play cards, when we get new card and insert it into arranged cards in our hands, So we will compare the card to the cards in our hand, when we find the card is greater than the find the first card in hand, we will insert it at the right of what we find. So below is the code.
```
def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        j = i
        while j > 0 and arr[j] < arr[j - 1]:
        tmp = arr[j]
        arr[j] = arr[j - 1]
        arr[j - 1] = tmp
        j = j - 1
        return arr
```

### [How I Fully Quit Google (And You Can, Too)](https://medium.com/s/story/how-i-fully-quit-google-and-you-can-too-4c2f3f85793a)
        The writer is a journalist, he once use lots product or google. But he realizes that google's server provide by it's products have a strong related to each othe. Although it bring convenience，but it's possible for google to analyze the data's relative among the products. This is maybe impossible once before, becuase has no one company have so many products used by users. 
        When a company become powerfull and more powerfull. Almost there is no way to restrict it. We can't just believe the company not do evil. May be writer is correct, not use only google's products, you have lots of choice.
